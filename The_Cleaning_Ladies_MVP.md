# The Cleaning Ladies MVP

## Introduction

A **minimal viable product** is the least number of features needed for a product so customers can use it and provide feedback. When a customer uses a product, we can see how they interact with it and see which features should be focused on and improved, including which are most used and which are not needed. This data can help make the product the best it can be by getting real-time feedback and implementing it.

## The Problem

Currently, cleaning services negotiate and schedule over text and phone calls. The cleaners are usually paid in cash, though some may have card readers. Some may find this troublesome, especially when handling a multitude of clients. To streamline this process, our product, **The Cleaning Ladies**, would provide an interface between the cleaners and their customers, leading to a more efficient experience. The product also provides support for users to find services, so cleaners would be able to advertise locally more efficiently.

## The Solution

The product would have two types of users: a **seller** and a **buyer**. A seller is an individual who owns a cleaning business while a buyer is someone who wants to purchase a cleaning service for their home or business. Depending on the user, they will have access to different features.

### Seller

The **seller** will be able to indicate where they are located and in which locations they service, the type of cleaning they provide, a price for the service, and a schedule upon which the buyer can indicate when they would like the service to be performed. They will be able to collect payment upon completion of the job. Once these features are implemented, the seller portion of the product shall be completed.

**What will be implemented**

+ A map for sellers to indicate which locations they service.
+ Type of cleaning provided.
+ Price.
+ Schedule.
+ Payment.

**What HAS to be implemented to reach MVP status**

+ Schedule.
+ Price.
+ Payment.


### Buyer

The **buyer** will be able to view services around the given address. This will help them select which seller they would like to purchase from. Upon selecting a service, additional information will be provided about the seller, such as name, type of job, and price. If the buyer is satisfied, the buyer can purchase the service and select a time slot from the schedule the seller provided. Once these features are implemented, the buyer portion of the product will be completed.

**What will be implemented**

+ View nearby services.
+ View seller information.
+ Purchase a service.
+ Schedule a service.

**What HAS to be implemented to reach MVP status**

+ Purchase a service
+ Schedule a service


## Additional Features Under Consideration

Future features that are under consideration once both portions of the product have been developed include a rating system, so buyers have more information to make a decision, and a messaging system, for negotiation or questions the buyer may have for the seller. A policy for fraudulent activity, such as a report and banning system, will have to be put in place as well. The implementation of these features will be decided upon after reviewing what the users of the product report.

**In summary**

+ A rating system.
+ A messaging system.
+ Report / ban system.
