CI/CD team philosophy and detailed implementation: 
	
	1. Documentation of the system process and configuration of product organization for repository, hosting, and deployment:
		a. We will be launching our project on a hosting site like Azure, AWS, or Google. This allows any user, tester, or developer
			to maintain the website. This also allows us as developers to see how the code will look/perform in real-time on the site. 
		b. We update our public GitHub repository very frequently and in small batches to assure that there is no errors, and if there are small 
			errors, we can fix them right away. We also include comments so we all understand what was updated or changed within the code. 
			
	2. Document the individual developer process (new team member) process and configuration:
		a. Our plan is to integrate the continuous integration practice of consistently and frequently updating our software. 
			We plan to push out our ccode in small fragments to avoid any major errors, and to fix any small errors that arise.
		b. New team members will have to complete Microsofts .Net tutorial before joining the team
		c. Team members will use IDE to connect to Github
		d. Team members need to install .Net in the command line
		e. Team members will run the code locally from IDE using Dotnet watch
		f. Team members will also check that the code pushed locally matches the code running on hosted site
			
	3. Document the new customer (user) process and configuration:
		a. Users will most likely be accessing our project thought the online-hosted version of the website, however, 
			users will also have access to our GitHub repository and can run it on their local machine. 
		b. Users can follow developer steps to run site locally, however they should almost always be able to run the product from a link
