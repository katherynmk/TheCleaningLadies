SPRINT 2 REVIEW:
Emily is hosting, and working with the team to get the template working and up. Katie is working with the tempalte to figure our the intricate details and implementing the starting HTML and CSS code. Cammie is Designing the website and logos, sending those to Katie to be implemented. Communication is good. Demos need to be better, code should be demoed and showed to the whole group so the group knows what is oging on with the project.
