SPRINT 2 REVIEW:
Emily is hosting, and working with the team to get the template working and up. Katie is working with the tempalte to figure our the intricate details and implementing the starting HTML and CSS code. Cammie is Designing the website and logos, sending those to Katie to be implemented. Communication is good. Demos need to be better, code should be demoed and showed to the whole group so the group knows what is oging on with the project. 

Sprint 3 Review:
As a team, we created our production and developer environment. We created a GitHub with documentation that assures that any user can follow the instructions and run the code locally. But we also created a production environment on Microsoft Azure in which users can open the code globally. We made sure that the instructions and documentation in the readme would enable anyone to run the code in any way, locally or globally.
	
	We also wanted to assure that the website was readable and clear. We worked on the CSS and the navigation bar along with the basic HTML to create a beautiful and dynamic environment. Any user young or old would be able to navigate through the site with ease and enjoy the simplistic yet elegant color scheme. This task was left up to and continues to be the job of Cammie.

	The team created a database to use throughout the site. This was a difficult yet necessary task that will be used throughout the development process. This quintessential part was done by Emily. 

	We decided to use Google calendars to keep with the clear and concise readability of the product. This part was completed by Katie.

	This sprint realized the cornerstones of the product, useability, and readability. We want a functional site that users want to use. 
  
  Sprint 4 Review:

	As a team, we continued to work tirelessly in our production environment. We did create an entirely new repository to ensure that there were no issues with our site being hosted through Microsoft Azure. Users can still also follow instructions to run the code locally. 
	Cammie is still working to ensure that the website is clean for users to navigate. Cammie and Katie continue to add to the pages and update the site CSS to make sure that everything is cohesive across the whole site. 
	Emily continues to work on the database, understanding how to store all the necessary pieces of user data, like account information (usernames, passwords) as well as creating functions so that users can successfully create their accounts and log in on the site. 
	Katie has still been researching and updating the best ways to showcase the calendar for users to book appointments as well as the Google maps feature so users can find cleaners in their area. 
	This sprint was a continuation of updating and enhancing the product's useability so that users can access our resources through a functional and cohesive site. 


SPrint 5 Review: 
This sprint was part of the winding down for the team. Most of the key features in the MVP have been completed. The website is very close to the teamâ€™s goals. While approaching finals, Katie decided to give her teammates easier stories as sort of a reward for all of their hard work this semester. 

Cammie worked on some cards to display information about cleaners more effectively and beautifully. While Katie and Emily do the rough code, Cammie refines it and makes it easier on the user's eyes. She has made the site much more appealing. 

Emily was responsible for the login and the encryption for that feature. Her personally designed code hashes passwords and works incredibly well with the website. She has done such amazing work on this site. She accomplished incredibly difficult tasks in a framework she was unfamiliar with promptly. She is a wonderful programmer and it has shown throughout the semester. 

Katie worked on getting Paypal and cards to work within the website. She had an easy time with this based on her newfound familiarity with .NET and the great documentation Paypal had on their website.
